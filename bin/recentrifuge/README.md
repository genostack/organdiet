# Recentrifuge
**Robust comparative analysis and contamination removal for metagenomic data**
____

With Recentrifuge, researchers can interactively explore what organisms are in their samples and at which level of confidence, thus enabling a robust comparative analysis of multiple samples in any metagenomic study.

Recentrifuge enables researchers to analyze results from the Centrifuge and LMAT classifiers using interactive pie charts, by placing great emphasis on the confidence level (score) of the taxonomical classifications.

In addition to the scored charts for the raw samples, four different sets of scored plots are generated for each taxonomic level of interest: control-subtracted samples, shared taxa (with and without subtracting the controls) and exclusive taxa per sample.

Recentrifuge is especially useful in the case of low biomass metagenomic studies and when a more reliable detection of minority organisms is needed, like in clinical, health security and forensic analysis.
